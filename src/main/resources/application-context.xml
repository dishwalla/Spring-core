 Initial 100
 -1 strange localDateTime bean in context which is not used.
     It seems you get some work as base)
     -It doesn't mean that I've used another project, if I have some unused thing in here it's just mean that I'm learning
 -1 strange mix of p:property with property tag
     -I did it on purpose - tried to use all kinds of things available in Spring
 -2 strange bean idGenerator in auditorium config and looks like it doesn't used at all - in same time there is another bean with same name which is used.

 -5 no every 10th strategy
 -5 event if you ignore 2nd strategy it should be list of them in discount service and algorithm to get maximum discount
 -1 strange copy of auditoriums to Set in auditoriums repository - and do not see when you use it, thus it looks strange and not used
 -2 many methods looks not used, why they are needed then?
 -5 it looks project is not implement partially
 -5 it looks like console app is not well yet (hope will be complete to next HW)
 -0 in classes I see "Created by dish on 01.10.17." who is this dish? (hope you have valid reason for that)
     -MacBook-Pro-Dish:checked_Olga_Pukhova_Spring-core-HW1 dish$ whoami
     dish
     that's me!
 -10 as deadline penalty
